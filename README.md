# single-spa-with-vuetify
Small test to find out how to setup single-spa where at least one app uses Vuetify

To create the apps, I followed the single-spa Quick Start: https://single-spa.js.org/docs/getting-started-overview#quick-start

After creating app2, I used <code>vue add vuetify</code>, made a plugin for vuetify.js (app2/plugins/vuetify.js), and added vuetify as an appOption in app2/src/main.js.
Link to material design icons were added to index.ejs
